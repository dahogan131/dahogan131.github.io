    <p>Hello, my name is Bigfoot. As a child, I had the opportunity to witness the Y2K scare and Dot Com Boom. Today, I have the pleasure of witnessing AI teach itself how to code and develop software. Since I cannot develop software as quickly as Dennis the Robot in the next cubicle over, I may be better served developing an AI to develop the software for me. I shall name him Oscar.</p>
    <h1>Here's my coworker, Dennis:</h1>

    <p> What's there to say? He drinks the last bit of coffee from the breakroom pot without replacing it and he didn't do anything for Secret Santa this year. Joke's on him; I was HIS Secret Santa... </p>

    <p> I got him a magnet. </p>
<p>Sure don't miss actually driving though. Looking back on it, people driving the cars just seems very silly. Besides, I much prefer streaming videos on my daily commute and letting the car deal with the headache of traffic.</p>
    <h3>A Schematic From my Old Colleague, Emily:</h3>
    <p>Now a senior consultant for a Minneapolis-based energy solutions firm, she sent me an old diagram from when her company was tasked with redesigning the municipality's aging and fossil fuel-dependent electrical grid.</p>
    <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10155735393323266%26set%3Da.10150163908168266.365706.799138265%26type%3D3&width=500" width="500" height="317" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>
    <p>While this diagram is a gross over-simplification of the modern American electrical grid, it also highlights the shortcomings of renewable energy sources at the time and the innovations in grid structuring that overcame said challenges. In 2032, the year of Ms. Beltt's publication, the issue was not a lack of energy potential in wind and solar derived generation; it was the fact that some days the sun didn't shine and the wind didn't blow. While Minneapolis recieved more solar-derived power than they would ever need in summer months, the sun had an irksome habit of trotting off for winter holiday. Consequentially, the challenge became providing sustainable energy in winter months and after-evening hours.</p>
    <p>Peer-reviewed articles dating back to the Obama Admistration outline a process of using renewable energy to convert atmospheric carbon into natural gas. As luck would have it, Ms. Beltt's municipality was lousy with natural gas-fueled power plants, so this option seemed most feasible. In the above diagram, you will see solar and wind farms (yellow and blue boxes, respectively) directing their harnessed energy to two recipients; grid substation (grey box) and Hydrocarbon Generation Plant (pink box). The farms prioritze their output to meet "at-that-moment" power demand by pushing it to the grid substations, with the excess power being rerouted to the generation plant.</p>
    <p>The Hydrocarbon Generation Plant (HGP) utilizes the energy surplus generated by the farms to produce natural gas, effectively storing surplus generation. It is important not to see hydrocarbons as an energy source in this equation, but rather a form of energy storage. The HGP forwards the natural gas product to the power plant (red box), where the gas is burned to generate power and sent to the grid substation when wind and solar sources cannot satisfy consumer demand. Roughly 95% of the carbon produced by the aformentioned combustion process is captured and transported back to the HGP to facilitate more energy storage. Kudos, Emily. Kudos.</p>
