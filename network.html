    <p>America has proven itself to be somewhat of a lame duck in terms of driverless transport innovation. Pioneered largely by the civic design revolution of the Asian continent nearly three decades ago, the Driverless Transport Network (DTN) operates on the principles of efficiency, diversification of medium and a precarious synergy between government and private enterprise. While both China and India boast comprehensive networks of hyperloop, light-rail and shared automobile, the U.S. has taken notice of their traffic solutions and is picking up pace with similar infrastructure innovations.</p>
    <p>The Driverless Transport Network is as diverse as it is autonomous. As we know today that it is very silly to have people driving the cars, we also understand the infeasibility of long-distance commute by automobile. Light rail is proving to be more feasible for long-distance commute, while rideshare maintains its market dominance for short-distance commute (< 15 km). While rideshare services are availabe practically nationwide, light rail infrastructure has been a slow development in the U.S. and will require more time to adequitely mitigate civic congestion.</p>
    <p>Hyperloop has won much of the world over, in terms of long distance transportation solutions. Utilized widely for transport of both passengers and goods throughout Asia, development has been slow in Europe, where light rail reins dominance. Here in America, Hyperloop has won many friends in terms of passenger transport, but commercial freight companies and their respective lobbyists remain less than amused. Admittedly, hyperloop is a powerful innovation for long-distance transport, but given the cost of infrastructure and the outdated nature of current regulations, it may take more time for it to catch on stateside.</p>
